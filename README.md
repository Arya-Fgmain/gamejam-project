# A little about this game
I made this game for the Mountaintop Game Jam organised by SFU's Game Development Club & Computing Science Student Society in July 2023.

# The Lore
A mysterious biker, obsessed with achieving *the peak* in his every endeavour, sets out to <strong>the Earth's core</strong> to challenge a fearful opponent. This opponent, we shall call him <strong>Egod</strong>, was banished to the Earth's core years ago for his unmatched combat skills. If the rider defeats Egod, all will be good. But there is always a chance, a 0.000001% chance that Egod prevails. If that happens then the fate of humanity is sealed, and earth will be conquered by Egod and his evil thirst for power will shine a gloomy shadow on the earth, FOREVER! Please win no pressure haha.

# The theme: it's all about <em>the peak</em>
The theme of the game jam was 'Peak,' and this is how it was implemented in this game:
<ul>
    <li>Is the game not fast enough for you? Well worry not! By pressing 0 while in-game, the player achieves 'Peak 0 Beast' mode, where his speed increases while transformed. This can be undone by pressing 0 again.</li>
    <li>The enemy png, although an unconventional choice, intentionally makes it difficult for the player to prevent a collision, so expect to achieve 'Peak Rage' while playing this game!</li>
    <li>There is a survival component to this game. In each round the player's survival time is counted. Their 'peak time' dictates their maximum survival time while they were playing the game.</li>
</ul>

# Implementation
The game was implemented using the Pygame Module, and is all written in Python v3.9.13.

# Try it out!
<ol>
    <li>Make sure you have Python installed on your system</li>
    <li>Clone this repository</li>
    <li>Install Pygame by typing 'pip install pygame' in your Terminal of choice</li>
    <li>Run the command 'python3 game.py,' enjoy!</li>
</ol>
