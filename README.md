# A little about this game ... it's all about *the peak*
I made this game for the Mountaintop Game Jam organised by SFU's Game Dev Club & Computing Science Student Society.

# The Lore
A mysterious biker, obsessed with achieving *the peak* in his every endeavour, sets out to the earth's core to challenge a fearful opponent. This opponent, we shall call him Egod, was banished to the earth's core years ago for his unmatched combat skills. If the rider defeats Egod, all will be good. But there is always a chance, a 0.000001% chance that Egod prevails. If that happens then the fate of humanity is sealed, and earth will be conquered by Egod and his evil thirst for power will shine a gloomy shadow on the earth, FOREVER! Please win no pressure haha.

# Game Jam Theme & Correlations
The theme of the game jam was 'Peak,' and this is how it was implemented in this game:
- Is the game not fast enough for you? Well worry not! By pressing 0 while in-game, the player achieves 'Peak 0 Beast' mode, where his speed increases while transformed. This can be undone by pressing 0 again.
- The enemy png, although an unconventional choice, intentionally makes it difficult for the player to prevent a collision, so expect to achieve 'Peak Rage' while playing this game!
- There is a survival component to this game. In each round the player's survival time is counted. Their 'peak time' dictates their maximum survival time while they were playing the game.

# Implementation
The game was implemented using the Pygame Module, and is all written in Python v3.9.13.
